Anything under heading 1 will appear in the floating table of contents (all heading 1 will auto populate the TOC)

##Who we are
These heading 2 entries will expand when you are on this section of the tutorial

##Other stuff


#R Basics

##Data, Objects, Operators

#Importing and plotting data

##Brain Dataset

```{r load data}

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
